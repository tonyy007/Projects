# Projects
Listed here are my projects I have. Each project is it's own folder, except for team projects and AvGeeks, which are links to separate repos containing projects. 

As with AvGeeks, there is some sensitive API information so I can't display the code base for it. However, I can display the link to the website. 
av-geeks.herokuapp.com

Similar reasoning for Music Penguin, except I can't display the link since the person responsible for hosting it doesn't have the funds for it.

Each file should explain what it is doing.
